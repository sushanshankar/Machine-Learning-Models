Regression

We have performed regression experiments on four datasets: Abalone, Automobile, DEE, and Elevator, taken from the UCI machine learning repository. 
For each dataset, we have used three different algorithms to perform regression: Linear Regression, XG Boost, and Artificial Neural Network.
